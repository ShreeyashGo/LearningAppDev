This project was a mini project.

The summary of the App:
I used a ListView for scrolling so I could go to the next or previous questions if I wanted to change my answer before submission. Each list item is in itself a column widget to arrange the text and the slider one below the other. The slider implemented has been improved for the UI with the labels indicating the current selected value. At the end there are 2 elevated buttons, one for submitting and one for resetting the selection. The reset button sets all the selected values to minimum value before changing. The submit button implement by Navigator widget to go to the results page which gave the necessary reaction to the feedback and another elevated button to ask the user to give another feedback.


My learning outcomes:
I learned a lot in this week. I was able to start learning dart and its Object-Oriented-Programing aspect. I learned how to use flutter commands and how to implement ListView, Column, Slider and Navigator widgets. I also learned a lot about the difference in a Stateful and a Stateless widget.
